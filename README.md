# **AOA Visualizer - Activity on Arrow (AOA) Project Management Visualization**

## **Overview**
The **AOA Visualizer** is a Java-based application that constructs and visualizes an **Activity on Arrow (AOA) network diagram** to represent project tasks, their dependencies, and scheduling information. This program leverages **GraphStream** for graph visualization and provides a structured way to determine the earliest and latest possible execution times for tasks in a project.

## **Features**
1. **Graph Visualization**: Uses **GraphStream** to display the AOA network as a directed graph.
2. **Task Dependency Management**: Supports manual and pre-defined input methods for task dependencies.
3. **Forward & Backward Pass Calculations**:
   - Calculates **Earliest Start (ES)** and **Earliest Finish (EF)** using forward pass.
   - Determines **Latest Start (LS)** and **Latest Finish (LF)** using backward pass.
4. **Slack Time Calculation**:
   - **Total Slack (TS)**: Measures total flexibility in scheduling.
   - **Free Slack (FS)**: Shows how much a task can be delayed without affecting successors.
5. **Critical Path Identification**: Highlights the sequence of tasks that determine the projectâ€™s minimum duration.
6. **Dummy Nodes for Complex Dependencies**: Handles multiple dependencies with **dummy nodes** to maintain AOA structure.
7. **Graph Styling**: Uses customized styling to differentiate real and dummy nodes and edges.

## **How It Works**
1. **User Input**: 
   - The user can choose to use a **predefined dataset** or enter **tasks manually**.
   - Each task requires a **name**, **duration**, and **preceding tasks**.
2. **Graph Construction**:
   - Nodes represent project events.
   - Directed edges represent **activities** with durations.
   - **Dummy nodes** are added where necessary to ensure correct dependency representation.
3. **Scheduling Calculations**:
   - **Earliest & latest start/finish times** are computed using a forward and backward pass.
   - Slack values are calculated to determine flexible and critical tasks.
4. **Graph Display**:
   - The graph is rendered using **GraphStream** with a **SpringBox layout** for optimal visualization.
   - The **critical path** can be highlighted for project managers.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Java**: Main programming language.
- **GraphStream**: Used for graph visualization.
- **Swing UI (optional)**: For user interaction.
- **Collections Framework**: Utilizes **HashMap, LinkedHashMap, ArrayList**, and **Set** for efficient data handling.

## **Use Cases**
- **Project Management**: Helps managers visualize and optimize project schedules.
- **Operations Research**: Used in academic and professional studies on scheduling and optimization.
- **Software Engineering**: Can be integrated into larger **project planning tools**.

This implementation provides a powerful way to **model, analyze, and optimize project workflows**, making it an essential tool for project managers and researchers in scheduling theory. ðŸš€
